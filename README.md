# Financial Risk Analysis with ANN (LendingClub Data)

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform. More information on Lending Club cn be found in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LendingClub).

## Our Objective

We will try to create a model based on our historical data from the customers to answer a question. Can we build a model that can predict wether or not a borrower will pay back their loan? Answering this question, we can predict and assess whether or not a new potential will pay back the loan. In the end, we will use classification metrics when evaluating the performance of our model.

## Sections

This project will include 3 sections to throughly complete the objective of the project. In the first section, we will explore the dataset and get to know the data better. In the second section, we will pre-process the data to prepare the dataset for the model creation, train and test the model. In the third and last step, we will evaluate model performance and deploy the model in a test to evaluate the model.

### Section 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
